# NFT Worlds Game Client

The NFT Worlds Game Client is the portal for players on PC, Mac and Linux systems to play the most immersive version of NFT Worlds.

The game client is currently in a very early alpha stage. [Please report any bugs or issues you encounter](https://github.com/NFT-Worlds/NFT-Worlds-Game-Client/issues/new).

## Building
To build the client as an installer, run `yarn run dist`  
To build the client as an unpackaged directory, run `yarn run dist:bare`

Both will output the result to the `dist` directory.

## Developing
To run the HMR dev server, run `yarn run dev`
